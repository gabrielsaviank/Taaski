# README

This is a simple Task App, that I'm building to remember rails/ruby

I made a very simple project, for more complex stuff check my Contracts Project.

Don't get bothered about the UI, the main purpose is the code behind.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version _2.7.3_

* System dependencies: Figaro, Mini_magic, Fog, Carrierwave

* Configuration

* Database _SqLite3_
